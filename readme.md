# Portfolio

## Overview

This is a portfolio website to display some services of the company "Something Something". This is currently under development. We will keep adding those features in readme as we add them to the website.

## Components

### Header

Header is the component of the website. It contains logo, name and navigation bar.
Here is the code for the header:

```html
<header>
  <div class="logo-name">
    <a href="./index.html">
      <img
        src="https://nexted.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CODR_Logo_Black-_-Green_RGB.png"
        alt="Coder_Academy_Logo"
      />
    </a>
    <p class="name">
      <span class="coder-text">Coder</span>
      <span class="academy-text">Academy</span>
    </p>
  </div>
  <nav>
